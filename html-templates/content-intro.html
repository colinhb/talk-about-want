<h1>Talk About Want</h1>
<p>Below you will find short summaries of the anonymous letters in <em>Want</em>, the collection edited by Gillian Anderson, organized and ordered as in the original.</p>
<p>These summaries were created using AI, specifically the large language model Claude 3.7 Sonnet from Anthropic.
   The prompt used appears after the list&mdash;you can skip to it <a href="#prompt">here</a>.</p>
<p>Though created on a whim, this collection may be valuable for book clubs and other groups reading <em>Want</em> together.
   It provides a quick way to review and reference the letters, potentially enhancing your discussions.</p>
<!-- <p>However, I think it can be a launching off point for a slightly different discussion: 
		how do we understand and value the output of AI here, and in other contexts?
		The original letters were written by people, and they are deeply personal expressions of their authors interior lives.
		But what about these summaries? Who wrote them? who is the "I" in these summaries?
		Are we interested in what they have to say?</p> -->
