<h1>... talk about <em>Want</em></h1>
<p>Below you will find short summaries of the anonymous letters in <em>Want</em>, the collection edited by Gillian Anderson, organized and ordered as in the original.</p>
<p>These summaries were created using AI, specifically the large language model Claude 3.7 Sonnet from Anthropic.
   The prompt used appears after the list&mdash;you can skip to it <a href="#prompt">here</a>.</p>
<p>Though created on a whim, this collection may be valuable for book clubs and other groups reading <em>Want</em> together.
   It provides a quick way to review and reference the letters, potentially enhancing your discussions.</p>
<!-- <p>However, I think it can be a launching off point for a slightly different discussion: 
		how do we understand and value the output of AI here, and in other contexts?
		The original letters were written by people, and they are deeply personal expressions of their authors interior lives.
		But what about these summaries? Who wrote them? who is the "I" in these summaries?
		Are we interested in what they have to say?</p> -->
<p>You can find out more about <em>Want</em> from its publisher, <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/want-9781526657893/" target="_blank">Bloomsbury Publishing</a>, on its website.

    <h3 id="on-fantasies"><span class="number">1.</span> On Fantasies</h2>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">1.</span> I yearn to reconcile my complex desires—to be both worshipped and dominated, to experience tender love and rough passion—while wrestling with the shame society has conditioned me to feel about my sexuality; my fantasy culminates in a dance floor encounter that leads to an intense, semi-public sexual experience against a bathroom wall where I'm simultaneously controlled and pleasured, with the thrill of potential discovery heightening my arousal as hands explore my body and I surrender to being filled while music pulses through me.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">2.</span> I fantasize about having a penis to experience the pleasure of making love to women with both care and fiery desire, but beyond that physical longing, my deepest fantasy is finding someone who truly loves, cherishes and desires me, creating a sweet, honest connection even if only for a brief moment in time.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">3.</span> My recent discovery of queerness has transformed my once-vanilla fantasies into rich, diverse scenarios—from BDSM to throuples to sex parties where my mouth is on someone's nipple and my hand inside them—though these liberating fantasies also leave me feeling ashamed and paralyzed, torn between sexual exploration in my mind and the frustration of my inexperienced, closeted reality.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">4.</span> I fantasize about a life after my husband's death where I could finally be brave enough to admit what I truly want—a woman with dark hair and tattoos whose simple touch set my body on fire, someone I imagine exploring bodies with when I'm alone with my vibrator, even as I remain resigned to a content but passionless marriage to my best friend.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">5.</span> While going about my mundane daily activities—riding the metro, crossing streets, shopping for groceries—I maintain a perfectly composed exterior while my mind secretly crafts elaborate sexual fantasies about encounters with famous figures, politicians, or completely imaginary men (and occasionally women), creating an exhilarating parallel reality that follows me through my otherwise normal life.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">6.</span> My ultimate fantasy is to feel genuinely and completely desired by my partner, to be ravished as if my body is a drug to them, making me feel wanted for exactly who I am rather than just another body, which in turn heightens my own arousal.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">7.</span> My sexual fantasies involve everyone except myself, as I prefer to create characters like Harriet to replace me in scenarios with my crushes and idols, because whenever I enter the picture I feel disgusted, despite wanting to experience sex with someone who intuitively knows what I need and makes me feel safe enough to surrender my identity.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">8.</span> Through the practice of lucid dreaming, I engage in nightly intimate encounters with the actor Pedro Pascal.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">9.</span> Since discovering fantasy as a tool for sexual enjoyment, I fantasize about multiple cocks of different sizes and shapes, particularly men riding each other or masturbating around me, with one favorite scenario being me masturbating on a banquet table while surrounded by fat, old, rich men with erect cocks who all want to fuck me.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">10.</span> My deepest and most enduring sexual fantasy, which I've kept secret from my husband and therapist despite it being the only thing that brings me to orgasm since high school, involves being consensually dominated by an older woman around my mother's age who uses me however she pleases—a desire that fills me with both intense pleasure and overwhelming guilt as I wonder if other women share these forbidden thoughts or if I'm destined to keep this craving hidden forever.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">11.</span> I live a devoted married life with my best friend who I still make love to despite our changed rhythms, but deep down I also yearn for two other lives: one filled with rough, emotionless encounters with dominant men who use my body without commitment, and another where I passionately love a wild, free woman whose touch awakens parts of me I never knew existed, both fantasies surfacing in those vulnerable moments between wakefulness and dreams.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">12.</span> Despite my husband seeing me as sexually vanilla, I secretly fantasize about being a famous porn star and sexual icon—a complete transformation from my pre-transition body that I've always hated—where I'm filming explicit scenes with multiple partners or just one, though I've settled for spicing things up with lingerie and filming sex with my husband as a compromise to my transgender reality.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">13.</span> I long for the passionate physical connection I shared with my husband of thirty-four years who recently passed away, finding myself caught between Catholic guilt about masturbation, fleeting infatuations with actors on screen, and the knowledge that while my husband wanted me to find someone new, I can't imagine replacing someone who fit me so perfectly.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">14.</span> In my rich fantasy worlds—whether I'm a powerful witch in revealing clothes having sex with wizards and witches, a zombie apocalypse survivor finding passion while fighting for my family, or engaging in threesomes where I'm always in charge—I escape the loneliness of my mostly sexless marriage and find the sexual freedom, power, and satisfaction I've been denied in reality.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">15.</span> My fantasy weaves together domestic partnership (having my husband help with chores, appreciate me, and take me out) with specific sexual desires: him going down on me, gentle touches along my body and scalp, finding that perfect position on top that brings me to orgasm, followed by being taken from behind, all culminating in a warm bath opening to a summer garden—half of which is already real, half I'm working to achieve.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">16.</span> Despite being told my fantasies are sinful, I can't help but imagine riding attractive men like Seabiscuit, performing oral sex, or being embraced intimately by sexy men or women—these inappropriate dreams give me hope and the will to live in a way that transcends simple arousal.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">17.</span> I dream of a partner who sees beyond my wheelchair, understands my disabilities without defining me by them, and isn't afraid to take control in the bedroom—someone who will pull my wheelchair close, put on the brakes, straddle me, and kiss me deeply, treating me as completely desirable while exploring my willingly submissive side in a safe, communicative environment.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">18.</span> As an asexual person who engages in sex with my husband for his pleasure rather than my own, I get myself in the mood by fantasizing about fictional characters—never myself or real people—developing intimate trust and connection, often getting drunk together, confessing feelings, and finally giving in to passion, creating a detailed narrative that helps me either prepare for partnered sex or achieve the endorphin release needed to fall asleep.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">19.</span> My most secret fantasy is my boyfriend proposing to me—not just as a daydream but as a meditative experience I call a 'masturtation'—where I imagine walking down dark stairs to a door leading to a mysterious, beautiful scenario where he kneels, asks the question with trembling words in a lush, maybe kitsch setting of wine, laughter and tears, culminating in intense masturbation as the embodiment of this powerful feeling.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">20.</span> I fantasize about being a successful, attractive woman who captivates Harry Styles leading to passionate sex, and I also imagine my partner being seduced by another woman who's desperately pursuing him despite his initial resistance—a fantasy that often leaves me in tears afterward, much like when I briefly fantasized about him with the woman he had an emotional affair with, though I'm now trying to focus on being present with my own sensations when I masturbate.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">21.</span> Having grown up in a strict religious environment that shamed sexuality, my fantasies revolve around uninhibited freedom - making love on beaches where he licks me as I hold his head, having sex against trees in forests, or even sneaking passionate encounters between theater scenes in period costume - all representing the wild, spontaneous sexuality I've been denied in my sexually mismatched marriage.</div>

    <h3 id="rough-and-ready"><span class="number">2.</span> Rough and Ready</h2>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">1.</span> In my dream, a mysterious stranger who becomes achingly familiar pulls me into an intensely intimate encounter where he exposes my innermost self with his knowing gaze and touch, eventually revealing himself as my own soul making transcendent love to me, merging my masculine and feminine essences in an otherworldly, spiritual climax that unfolds me completely.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">2.</span> I long to be utterly objectified, filled in all my holes simultaneously by countless strangers, watched and cheered on by an audience as I surrender completely to pleasure, transforming from woman to fuck hole, finding my ultimate release in this primal escape from the mental load of everyday life.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">3.</span> Despite being an outspoken feminist in control of my life, I deeply crave surrender—to be completely possessed by someone who desires me intensely, with hands on the back of my neck, a solid body against mine, and filthy whispers that tell me I'm wanted without the need for BDSM accessories, just raw, tide-of-desire intimacy where I don't have to make choices or be the initiator.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">4.</span> I fantasize about my supervisor at the park where we do maintenance work, longing for him to dominate me with his strong hands and perfect body—whether it's rough, desperate sex with him finishing inside me at work, or him tying me up and teasing me before tenderly cuddling me afterward—creating an intimate world where only he and I exist in passionate pleasure.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">5.</span> I fantasize about sex so intense it causes fainting, consumes my thoughts for days, becomes a treasured memory I revisit for years, and culminates in creating erotic art with our bodies and fluids on canvas that we'd proudly display as an intimate secret between us when guests admire it.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">6.</span> I fantasize about deep, raw-dog anal sex.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">7.</span> I am a machine of nourishment and pleasure, rhythmically being devoured and consumed by multiple lovers who suckle at my teats, vulva, and arse while I feed them and am fed in return, all of us moving to a crucial beat that sustains our mindless, mechanical cycle of consumption and penetration that defines my purpose.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">8.</span> I long for a sexual experience that begins with anticipation and longing, evolves through vulnerability and desire, and culminates in losing control as my partner flips me around the mattress, showing me I'm irresistible—though I sometimes drift back to an old fantasy about Birgitte from Borgen coming home from politics to take me forcefully on the kitchen table, illuminated by the open refrigerator light.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">9.</span> Standing naked in front of the mirror, I admire my raw, voluptuous curves before indulging in vivid fantasies of a lover who pins me against walls, sucks my breasts, leaves hickeys across my body, performs oral sex while I'm perched on a table with my legs on his shoulders, pours honey on my belly and into my pussy before licking it clean—fantasies so intense that I orgasm multiple times just imagining them.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">10.</span> I fantasize about a television actor named "Jason" who awakens my long-dormant sexuality, making love to me tenderly despite my cancer-related mastectomies, bringing me to multiple earth-shattering orgasms as he whispers sweet affirmations in my ear, holds me close during vulnerable moments, and ultimately fills the void of intimacy I've been missing for so long.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">11.</span> Despite being a firm feminist, I fantasize about being completely dominated—held down, called degrading names, used solely for a man's pleasure—but my deepest arousal comes from breeding fantasies where I'm repeatedly impregnated, milked like livestock, and fucked by faceless men, a fantasy that contradicts my real-life beliefs yet makes me orgasm every time.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">12.</span> Despite my anxieties about pregnancy and my type-A personality, I secretly fantasize about the raw intimacy and total abandon of having someone ejaculate inside me—watching his face flush as I grip his hair while he moans and fills me completely, experiencing the messy, desperate wanting that transcends my usual need for control.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">13.</span> I fantasize about an anonymous, uninhibited encounter with a stranger who finds me masturbating, taking control without tenderness, pinning me down, telling me what to do, and making me come repeatedly while I keep my eyes closed, reveling in the voyeuristic thrill of possibly being caught and the pure, raw lust that contrasts with my satisfying but conventional married sex life.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">14.</span> I fantasize about passionate, animalistic sex where I'm dominated with bruising grips and pleasurable bites, engulfed in raw sensations without self-consciousness—the kind where I feel helplessly crushed under someone's weight, aroused by their hushed, violating words, and wake up the next day deliciously sore as a reminder of our all-consuming encounter.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">15.</span> As a sexually fluid, strong-minded woman who is typically in control, I long to be thoroughly ravaged by a tall German man who would make me his "all-centre pleasure zone," leaving me so exhausted from screaming-until-I'm-hoarse pleasure that I cannot stand for days, ending up on the floor dripping from everywhere with a shit-eating grin while he catches his breath.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">16.</span> I fantasize about explosive, primal sex where I'm so consumed by desire that I can't think straight—where the power struggle and fight for dominance leads to clothes being torn off against walls, hot skin against skin, and pleasure so intense that I forget my insecurities and even their name, experiencing the mind-numbing passion I've never had in real life.</div>

    <h3 id="to-be-worshiped"><span class="number">3.</span> To Be Worshipped</h2>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">1.</span> I fantasize about a person who deeply worships me, craving my body with carnal, obscene desire.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">2.</span> I crave to be worshipped and idolized for my beauty and sexual potency, to be the undeniable center of attention where my every whim is instantly fulfilled, to be seen, loved, and devoured by someone who recognizes my worth beyond the exhausting expectations of modern womanhood where I'm pulled in countless directions yet never feel quite enough.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">3.</span> My deepest sexual fantasy is to be worshipped as a divine goddess under moonlight, with a devoted partner who begs for my attention and praises me endlessly, where I maintain complete control while they pleasure me slowly and passionately, knowing that I am allowing their pleasure and that I will forever remain their ultimate fantasy.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">4.</span> I fantasize about being touched all over my hypersensitive skin, not just in explicitly sexual ways but as a complete bodily experience where many hands caress me simultaneously, awakening every neuron and leaving me floating in pure sensational bliss, held and worshipped like something precious.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">5.</span> In my marriage where I feel disregarded, I fantasize about a masculine yet gentle man who worships me completely - secretly watching me undress before surprising me with his touch, then taking his time to pleasure my body before passionate, rough sex that leaves me squirting and feeling utterly seen and desired.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">6.</span> My fantasy is to be genuinely desired and craved, to have someone be driven wild with lust from just a glimpse of my body—the thought of being so desperately wanted by someone who finds me irresistible turns me on immensely, perhaps because it gives me a sense of power I've never experienced growing up as an unattractive girl.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">7.</span> My deepest sexual fantasy is to be worshipped as an all-powerful goddess, commanding complete dominance over a submissive man who begs, pleads, and thanks me for any attention I bestow upon him, while I radiate such overwhelming sexuality and power that my mere presence strikes fear and awe before I take complete control.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">8.</span> As a lesbian with no attraction to men or penises, I find it paradoxically arousing to fantasize about someone ejaculating inside me—not for pregnancy but because the thought that my body could bring someone to such intense pleasure that they lose control and fill me is intensely erotic to me.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">9.</span> My fantasy revolves around a man I'm deeply attracted to—either a past crush or a gorgeous celebrity close to my age—who unexpectedly meets me at a bar, exhibits genuine interest in me, engages in passionate foreplay that leads to tender yet intense sex where he continuously affirms my beauty and desirability, all culminating in the "murderously simple" experience of someone being glad when I walk into the room, someone who is thrilled that I am the person in bed with them.</div>

    <h3 id="off-limits"><span class="number">4.</span> Off Limits</h2>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">1.</span> I am in love with my best friend and constantly fantasize about having sex with her throughout my daily life.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">2.</span> I fantasize intensely about intimate moments with women—imagining kisses, scents, and beautiful, dreamlike scenes—though these fantasies always involve unattainable women like actresses or characters from movies, not people close to me, and while my husband knows and accepts this aspect of my imagination, I keep it hidden from my friends due to cultural taboos around female sexuality in Latin America.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">3.</span> I fantasize about a night where, after drinking wine with a recently-single female friend while my husband is away, a tentative kiss leads to passionate, explorative sex where we take turns pleasuring each other, culminating in the most intense orgasms I've ever experienced, leaving me completely satisfied yet somewhat surprised by my comfort with this unexpected encounter.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">4.</span> I fantasize about the married bricklayer who worked next door during lockdown—the way our eyes locked across my kitchen window, how I longed to touch his golden skin and squeeze his bum when he hugged me goodbye and gave me his hoodie, which I still wear and wonder if he can feel it when I do.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">5.</span> I fantasize about unattainable women—the subway stranger, the married professor, the committed friend—where we share passionate kisses, lingering touches, and late-night conversations in a forbidden romance that exists within stolen moments and hopeful glances, all while wondering if I'm drawn to the impossible because I fear true connection or can't imagine being loved unconditionally for who I am.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">6.</span> In my fantasy, while my husband is asleep upstairs, I masturbate in our home office to porn until his friend catches me, joins me for passionate, spontaneous sex on the desk, and then the next morning gives me a secret orgasm while my husband is packing the car for their trip together, leaving me breathless and glowing with our delicious secret.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">7.</span> My deeply meaningful fantasy, born from rebellion against Orthodox religious restrictions that forbid women from entering the altar, is to have a man (perhaps even a young, willing priest) perform oral sex on me as I lie on a church altar, with my moans of pleasure filling the sacred space—a testament to my belief that sex can be one of life's most religious experiences.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">8.</span> I fantasize about being fucked in a church, right in the pews beneath stained-glass windows while staring at Jesus on the cross.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">9.</span> Having grown up in a repressive evangelical environment, I now fantasize about having an illicit affair with a pastoral couple, particularly enjoying how we'd engage in secret sex where the husband watches his wife being intimate with me, finding excitement in the taboo nature of our religious boundaries while also savoring the power to potentially expose their hypocrisy.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">10.</span> Despite having followed the traditional South Asian life script with my husband whom I love, I fantasize about his older brother when we make love—imagining him watching us or wondering what it would feel like if it were him inside me instead, the man who's always looked at me with burning desire even after I became his sister-in-law.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">11.</span> I fantasize about the forbidden thrill of seducing my best friend's brother—the tall, dark, and handsome man I imagine is hung like a god—having him confess he's wanted me for years before we engage in increasingly passionate sex, from gentle to rough, with the risky excitement of potentially being caught by his sister, as he makes me scream and see stars in ways no other man has.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">12.</span> I remember and fantasize about my past lover - how she would confidently command my body, pin me against the wall with my arms above my head, penetrate me anally with her perfect manicure as I squirt in ecstasy, our blonde and brunette hair entwining like dessert - these forbidden memories of what we once had still bring me to climax every time.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">13.</span> My rich fantasy life centers around working as an art manager in an Italian mansion where I have passionate encounters with the wealthy owner's two sons - first the muscular, sweet-talking younger brother, then the serious, business-minded older one - eventually evolving into threesomes, marriage to the older brother, an open relationship where I continue sleeping with both brothers, and multiple children from both men, creating a parallel life that has become both a sexual escape and a way to explore alternate versions of myself.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">14.</span> Despite having a great sex life with my loving husband of five years, I fantasize about fisting and feeling FULL, but I'm too embarrassed to share this desire with him because of societal shame around vaginal "looseness," even though I secretly watch and enjoy porn featuring large insertions.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">15.</span> My most intense sexual fantasy involves my boyfriend ejaculating inside me without a condom, as the idea of his semen inside my vagina feels incredibly satisfying and would trigger my own orgasm instantly, though he doesn't know that when we're having sex and I uncontrollably tighten around him, I'm actually dreaming of him finishing inside me.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">16.</span> I have an intense erotic fantasy about my therapist—a gorgeous older woman with a tiny tattoo and authoritative English accent—where our final session leads to passionate kissing and an unexpected sexual encounter where I pleasure her first with my mouth and fingers, then we grind together until we both climax, all while knowing this intimacy remains firmly in my imagination.</div>

    <h3 id="the-captive"><span class="number">5.</span> The Captive</h2>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">1.</span> My most intense fantasy, which I've come to accept despite its conflict with my feminist values, involves a group of unseen men who unexpectedly enter my apartment, blindfold me, and despite initially intending to ignore me, become irresistibly drawn to my arousal, touching me with increasingly bold hands until one of them finally, reluctantly, slides inside me—that moment of penetration being all I need to climax.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">2.</span> My fantasy involves being captured by a group of attractive biker men who initially tease me before turning to sexual domination when I try to escape, culminating in them taking turns using all three of my holes, restraining me when I resist, forcing multiple orgasms with a vibrator attached to my clit, and continuing their rough, pleasurable use of my body throughout the night.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">3.</span> My fantasy involves being kidnapped by dangerous terrorists who initially scare me, then one captor unexpectedly initiates passionate, consensual sex—the erotic contradiction being how his tender, respectful touch contrasts with the darkness and violence still visible in his eyes—before finally releasing me into freedom.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">4.</span> My lifelong fantasies have evolved from innocent scenarios of being injured and nursed back to health to more explicit ones where I'm incapacitated, tied up, or menaced—always relinquishing control and experiencing the freedom of having things happen to me without needing to give consent, which feels liberating in ways my consent-focused real life cannot provide.</div>

    <h3 id="kink"><span class="number">6.</span> Kink</h2>

    <div class="letter"><span class="number">3.</span> I'm aroused by period sex—heterosexual, lesbian, or anywhere between—because it's raw, messy, natural, and intimate, breaking stigmas while celebrating the beauty of bodies that can bear children, plus it tastes good and brings fun to something often hidden.</div>

    <div class="letter"><span class="number">5.</span> I find freedom and arousal in deliberately wetting my bed and clothes, especially in pull-ups that make me feel small yet confident, while also fantasizing about a lover who discovers my bedwetting, comforts me through my "accidents," and helps me clean up—sometimes with elements of humiliation, sometimes with protection, depending on my mood.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">6.</span> I fantasize intensely about being "filled" during sex—the sensation of a man finishing inside me, feeling his semen against the back of me, and watching it slowly run down my thighs afterward—a desire so consuming that if a man could never run out, I'd never leave the bed, constantly craving more.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">7.</span> My biggest sexual fantasy involves playing the role of a black leopard, embracing a unique power dynamic where I'm a pet with a sadistic streak, wearing ears, tail and sharp-clawed gloves, lounging at my mistress's feet like a guardian, or being commanded to hunt other submissives - a grey area between dominance and submission that feels empowering for both me and my girlfriend.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">8.</span> My ultimate fantasy is to embrace both my transgender female identity and my AB/DL desires by being in a lesbian relationship where my girlfriend makes love to me while I'm wearing and wetting diapers, finally allowing me to experience the feminine sexual pleasure I've always craved rather than living vicariously through partners.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">9.</span> I fantasize about blood exchange with someone I deeply love, finding the idea intensely erotic and connected to my submissive desires: being bound, controlled, and cut with sharp scissors or scalpels, with our blood being exchanged and licked—perhaps inspired by vampire scenes in films like Dracula and other movies that awakened me to submission.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">10.</span> My ultimate sexual fantasy involves shared indulgence where I and a partner (or two) enjoy a big dinner together, then engage in intimate play focused on our bloated bellies—with hands rubbing my expanded stomach while someone performs oral sex on me, all while being made to feel completely accepted despite my unconventional arousal at the temporary fullness and gluttony that has excited me since childhood.</div>

    <div class="letter"><span class="number">3.</span> In my fantasy, I become a man with a "butler" who presents me with five naked women on a large bed, and I'm allowed to selectively pleasure them (fingering, licking, and fucking) according to my butler's rules, savoring their unique scents and tastes while taking my time to explore their bodies until I finally climax inside one woman while another rides my face, all before watching my butler take his unrestricted turn.</div>

    <div class="letter"><span class="number">7.</span> Despite being a strong, dominant woman in my professional and sexual life, my deepest fantasy is to surrender all control, to be tied up, teased and denied release, to be a submissive "good girl" kept in line with tiny punishments of pain, to be caged and disciplined, all while being cared for in a dynamic where I don't have to overthink anything.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">8.</span> Despite my feminist values and professional success, I crave having my boyfriend dominate me completely—choking me, calling me a slut, spanking me until I'm bruised, controlling my pleasure remotely in public—giving me the degradation, humiliation, and danger I deeply desire.</div>

    <div class="letter"><span class="number">17.</span> My most intimate fantasies center around transcending traditional roles of passive/active and disabled/empowered—evolving from teenage body-swap scenarios with my teacher to adult fantasies where, from my wheelchair and ventilator-dependent body, I become the empowered caretaker with partners like a nurse, finding sexual agency not despite my physical limitations but by recognizing that giving pleasure and receiving it, being cared for and caring for others, are never mutually exclusive states.</div>

    <div class="letter"><span class="number">1.</span> I am consumed by an irresistible desire for my beautiful neighbor Edith, fantasizing about exploring her body with my hands and mouth, learning how to pleasure another woman as she teaches me everything she knows, our bodies entwined in passionate lovemaking with fingers, tongues, and toys—all while knowing this affair will likely remain forbidden as she's happily married to her wife and I to my husband.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">2.</span> I fantasize about my husband being more dominant and adventurous—tying me up, using butt plugs, trying anal sex for the first time—and also about being pleasured by two women who, along with my husband, would have total control over my body, pulling my nipples and penetrating me deeply in a hard, passionate exploration without apologies.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">3.</span> I fantasize about being invited to join a Berlin sex club by a female bartender, later arriving at a mysterious mansion where I consent to be a "sex toy" for a diverse group of women who domme me completely—experiencing everything from penetration to BDSM—allowing me to explore my pansexuality in a safe, affirming environment despite my committed relationship with a man.</div>

    <div class="letter"><span class="number">5.</span> I have two fantasies that torment me: one where I'm in a rough, sweaty three-way with two men—mascara running, drugs nearby, being taken forcefully from behind—and another that feels more transgressive to me, where I'm loved tenderly by a conventional man in a clean suburban home who genuinely cares for me; it's this second fantasy that makes me feel sick, revealing something unsettling about my sexuality.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">6.</span> Despite my confusing journey with sex and gender, I've come to realize that my deepest fantasy is to passionately fuck women with an imaginary penis attached to my female body - not a strap-on, but something that feels like a part of me - giving them the pleasure my male partner failed to give me.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">7.</span> I still fantasize about a sweet French boy I once dated, imagining dressing him in my feminine clothes during carnival, applying lipstick to his delicate lips, and then making love to him with my unused strap-on dildo—entering him with the same tenderness he showed me, experiencing the reciprocity of penetration while caressing his silky skin and whispering French words of love.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">8.</span> My most intimate sexual fantasy is to make love to myself—not as a twin or clone but as a supernatural duplication where I experience both the giving and receiving of pleasure simultaneously, feeling what it's like to possess both male and female anatomy, to be penetrated and to penetrate, to know exactly what my partner feels, and to give myself exactly what I want without having to ask.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">9.</span> I am a bisexual woman who fantasizes about intimately exploring women's bodies and pleasuring them in ways I can't with my husband, often imagining an alternate life where I'm free to date women, have one-night stands, or even experiencing widowhood that would allow me to finally act on my deep yearning for lesbian experiences that I only discovered after committing to a heterosexual marriage.</div>

    <div class="letter"><span class="number">1.</span> Though outwardly I'm a frumpy fifty-year-old woman trapped in a sexually unfulfilling marriage, in my fantasy I transform into a young, curvaceous beauty who's gang-banged by multiple well-endowed men at a masked sex party, where they take turns pleasuring and penetrating me in an endless cycle that satisfies the deep hunger for penetration my real life lacks.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">2.</span> I fantasize about having multiple husbands who know and like each other within a polyamorous network where no one owns anyone, obligation is replaced by honesty and friendship, and shared affection creates more love for everyone, allowing sexual energy to be healing.</div>

    <div class="letter"><span class="number">4.</span> In my fantasy, I embody a sexually liberated flapper and renowned singer in 1930s New York, where I, exuding confidence and sensuality in my ruby-velvet garments, bring an attractive couple up to my apartment after my performance at a speakeasy, initiating an intimate encounter in my heated pool that evolves into a passionate threesome where I maintain complete control—allowing the husband to ultimately pleasure me while his wife watches in awe—before sending them away, as I remain gloriously unattached and free to choose my next admirers.</div>

In my fantasy, I am the only female living in an isolated monastery where I happily perform daily "duties" for all the monks, including fellating them in hallways, waking them by lowering myself onto their faces or erections, and reporting my varied sexual activities to the abbot who masturbates me to orgasm as I recount my day.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">9.</span> I fantasize about running a bachelorette sex-dungeon business where I'd welcome groups of women, give the bride a massage that turns sexual with her consent, pleasure each woman in the bridal party with toys or myself, creating a celebration of women's pleasure that satisfies my desire to pleasure women and get paid for it.</div>

    <div class="letter"><span class="number">14.</span> My fantasy is to be tied to the kitchen island while my husband and a mutual friend take turns using me as a "pleasure station," teasing and fondling my breasts, using my mouth, and eventually taking me from both ends in the sitting room—all while I'm blindfolded and they prepare a meal together, leaving me feeling wonderfully used yet powerful and liberated by being treated exactly as I desire.</div>

    <h3 id="the-watchers-and-the-watched"><span class="number">11.</span> The Watchers and the Watched</h2>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">1.</span> I fantasize about watching my husband have sex with a beautiful woman we encountered on a cruise years ago, imagining myself bringing her to our cabin where she strips nude, tells him she's been dreaming of fucking him, and I watch her pleasure him until he finishes inside her—this thought always makes me orgasm when he's going down on me.</div>

    <div class="letter"><span class="number">3.</span> I fantasize about pegging my husband and making him watch while his best friend has sex with me, which satisfies both my desire to be dominant when he doesn't want sex as much as I do, and my contrasting need to be the object of desire who is passionately taken by someone strong and caring.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">4.</span> Although I'm a busy mother whose sex life has become obligatory and disconnected, I find profound release in my private fantasies of forbidden lovers—beautiful, sun-kissed versions of myself with a tall, handsome man—who share an intense, passionate connection where the most arousing moment comes when their foreheads touch and they maintain eye contact during simultaneous orgasm, creating not just physical but soul-deep intimacy.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">5.</span> I fantasize about my executive director calling me into his glass-walled office, where he has me face his desk, unzips my skirt while I'm wearing no panties, and fucks me from behind with his hard penis until I drip come down my legs, all while anyone walking by could see us.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">6.</span> In my recurring fantasy since a young age, my boyfriend undresses me in a cinema theater and leads me naked onto the stage where he "displays" me to an all-male audience, declaring they can look but not touch, while also selecting men to pleasure themselves until they ejaculate over me—I feel both scared and excited, vulnerable yet protected, in this scenario that reliably brings me to orgasm when I imagine it.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">7.</span> Though I'm more attracted to women in real life, my fantasies almost exclusively involve men and have grown increasingly extreme—typically featuring myself in provocative clothing being displayed by my gentleman companion to others (delivery guys, party guests, invited spectators), progressing through escalating sexual scenarios with clear boundaries (they can look and touch, but only my gentleman gets to fuck me), all while incorporating elements of submission, exhibitionism, and voyeurism that culminate in being taken by my gentleman while others watch.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">8.</span> My favorite sexual fantasy is imagining myself as a man watching my wife perform in a live sex show, where she dresses as a maid and has passionate sex with a handsome young man on stage, while I and other aroused audience members—both men and women—masturbate or engage in their own sexual activities, building to a crescendo where we all climax together.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">9.</span> I fantasize about watching men have sex with each other, reveling in their unrestrained moans as they fight for power, while I remain untouched yet commanding—eventually being hunted, eaten, and worshipped alongside their mutual worship of one another.</div>

    <div class="letter"><span class="number">11.</span> In my fantasy, I kneel naked except for a collar before my ex-partner in a dimly lit room, transcending into weightless freedom as he spanks me to welts while praising me, before devouring me sexually against a glass wall where faceless voyeurs watch and applaud as he expertly brings me to climax with his fingers and tongue, then presses me against the glass and enters me from behind—my audience's whispers and his praise merging with the thunder of my blood as we explode together in ecstasy.</div>

    <h3 id="i-have-always-had-a-thing-for"><span class="number">12.</span> I Always Have A Thing For...</h2>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">1.</span> I fantasize about being kept after class by my middle-aged teacher who locks us in his office, where passionate kissing leads to him going down on me with incredible enthusiasm before we have intense sex against his bookshelf, ending with tender hair-stroking and a final long kiss.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">2.</span> I fantasize about meeting an older, confident, professional woman in a hotel room where I take my time pleasuring her sexually—kissing her deeply, slowly undressing her, exploring her body, and giving her multiple orgasms through oral sex and fingering—before we part ways, only to later share a secret knowing glance when I see her with her husband at a restaurant.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">3.</span> I fantasize about being a housemaid or governess in period costume, having urgent, passionate sex with my employer's son who has returned from military expedition—we meet in a carriage, pull up skirts and unbutton breeches, fucking breathlessly while risking discovery, which excites me because of the repression of the era, the costume layers, the urgency, the semi-public nature, and feeling desperately desired by this gentleman.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">4.</span> I fantasize about being dominated by a soft butch woman with sun-kissed skin and curly dark hair in an old projection booth where she takes me against the wall - kissing my neck, tasting me, making me come - while telling me she won't ever let go, and I long for her not just sexually but in everyday life, even though she only exists in my imagination.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">5.</span> For twelve years, I've relied on the memory of my ex-boyfriend's three phrases—"You like that, do you?", "My big hard cock making you come...", and "Making you moan"—while touching myself, the only meditation that works for me as I bite my lip, rub circles around my clitoris, and recall the feeling of being stretched open and bitten in return.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">6.</span> I fantasize about being swept off my feet by an older man who genuinely desires me, craving that intoxicating mix of devotion and controversy where I can be truly seen beyond the shame ingrained by my Catholic upbringing—wanting to give my soul to someone who values me as more than just a passing encounter.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">7.</span> I crave the sexual attention of men in their twenties despite being married to a traditional conservative man, as I fear growing old and desperately want to feel young and desired by virile men forever, though I know this isn't possible.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">8.</span> In my fantasy world, I'm my younger self having a sensual encounter with my ideal type of man—a beautiful twenty-something with dark eyes and strong hands—where we share intimate moments in a Lake Como hotel, making passionate love in our room before venturing out to a restaurant where, aroused by seeing two women secretly pleasuring each other, we have urgent, uninhibited sex against a wall in a side alley, all while I feel completely free and proud.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">9.</span> I fantasize about my boyfriend having an intensely erotic experience with a beautiful visiting manicurist who seduces him into sexual bliss—starting with innocent nail care that escalates to her offering to remove her clothes, performing oral sex, and ultimately having passionate intercourse with him—only for me to return home later completely unaware of his betrayal except for the suspicious dinner he's prepared.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">10.</span> I fantasize about owning perfectly built, sexually functioning male robots that I could program to fulfill my desires, especially scenarios where multiple men pleasure me in various roles like a teacher or babysitter, with the robots being wonderful lovers whose greatest pleasure is mine, all in absolute safety and privacy away from the constraints of our primitive, male-dominated world.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">11.</span> From childhood, I've been aroused by men in uniforms, which has evolved into a shared fantasy with my husband where we role-play inviting a third person—a rugged soldier we call "Billy the Third"—who helps around our home before joining us in passionate, explicit threesome sex that culminates in both men penetrating me simultaneously while I experience mind-spinning pleasure.</div>

    <h3 id="gently-gently"><span class="number">13.</span> Gently, Gently</h2>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">1.</span> I want to be kissed on the lips – gently or roughly with passion – once more before I die, yet admitting this simple desire fills me with embarrassment and terror, as if acknowledging such a small need makes it shamefully real.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">2.</span> My escape is in the forbidden fantasy of him—the man who holds my neck while I climax from his fingers deep inside me—a daydream that overtakes me at mundane moments like waiting at the dentist's office, allowing me to feel liberated from my everyday maternal responsibilities through an intimate connection that awakens me through raw truth, uninhibited sensuality, and the comfort of being fully accepted while asking nothing in return.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">3.</span> I crave intimate, sensual touch accompanied by eye contact that conveys deep desire, connection, and most importantly, love—not casual encounters, but the kind of authentic human connection through sexual pleasure that offers glimpses of what it truly means to be alive.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">4.</span> I dream of being touched, of having someone who desires me and wants to give me pleasure, as at fifty years old I'm weary of self-improvement if it means accepting a life without physical affection or sexual excitement.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">5.</span> My deepest sexual fantasy is to feel safe and loved during intimacy—to engage in passionate, enjoyable sex with someone I truly trust who appreciates my body, perhaps incorporating some light kink like choking and dirty talk, without dissociating or feeling inadequate, where I can actually be mentally present and experience pleasure rather than fear.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">6.</span> I fantasize about connecting with nature in an intimate, sexual way—undressing in a secluded valley, stimulating myself with twigs and leaves, rubbing against the soil, and finally pressing my body against a tree while moaning in gratitude to Mother Nature for the pleasure my mind and body can experience through her.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">7.</span> In my fantasy, I am lost in a forest where I encounter a gentle, powerful Bigfoot with whom I share an intensely satisfying sexual experience that combines animal passion with mystical connection, all while being watched by wolf-people who later join us in comforting post-coital intimacy, leaving me feeling safe, satisfied, and complete in our nest of fur and foliage.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">8.</span> My deepest sexual fantasy revolves around what I call 'Care Play' - specifically, an elaborate scenario where I'm an adult student at a magical university like Hogwarts, wandering at night until my favorite professor offers me a calming potion, which leads to intimate moments where he makes me feel safe, understood, and cared for, fulfilling my core desire to build trust and feel protected by someone who truly sees me.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">9.</span> I yearn for a nurturing relationship with a slightly older woman whose quiet confidence allows me to finally feel safe and fully present during sex, where her gentle touch and patient guidance lift away my lifetime of fear and shame, creating a protective cocoon where our intimacy becomes an exploratory game, a peaceful joy, and a home we return to again and again.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">10.</span> I fantasize about an attentive, faceless man who slowly builds trust and intimacy with me through gentle touches, constant communication, and mutual pleasure—who shows me reverence while guiding me through passionate sex where I feel safe enough to orgasm multiple times, and who stays to hold me afterwards with promises of exploring our deepest desires together.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">11.</span> Though I don't feel sexual attraction like others do, my fantasy involves being admired in a red dress, then transported to the woods where a white horse takes me on a ride that arouses me, culminating in an encounter with a green-eyed woman in a suit who asks for my consent, makes love to me with an onion involved, and leaves me feeling cherished, small, and completely content under the stars.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">12.</span> In my sixties, I fantasize about being splayed on a forest floor, hillside, or beach where all the animals are watching and one or more of them (often a deer) performs cunnilingus on me—never coitus—or I sometimes imagine being a landscape with a river gushing through me.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">13.</span> I wander through an ancient forest at night in my threadbare dress, not afraid but thrilled as a group of fauns—especially the one with chocolate brown eyes whom I desire most—find me by my scent, and together with another woman brought by the fauns, we surrender to their skillful thrusts in the velvet darkness, becoming part of the forest's magic as we're filled with pleasure and later returned to our separate villages, leaving me longing for our next encounter when I will again escape my drab life for joy.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">14.</span> My most cherished fantasy isn't extravagant gestures or expensive gifts, but rather a partner who is genuinely, ordinarily nice to me—who takes his time with my pleasure in bed, holds me close in the morning, explores my body with gentle anticipation, accompanies me through mundane activities like shopping with genuine interest in my thoughts and needs, engages intellectually with my ideas, and throughout it all, makes me feel truly cared for, seen, and respected in both intimate and everyday moments, never rushing away or making me feel that my pleasure is an inconvenience.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">15.</span> I fantasize about a man who truly loves me for my authentic self rather than objectifying me as merely a sexual object.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">16.</span> My biggest fantasy is to find genuine affection and warm connection during sex—not just physical pleasure that ends with me feeling unsatisfied, but something meaningful with someone who truly cares about me.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">17.</span> In my greatest fantasy, I awaken after falling asleep naked beside a tropical waterfall to find several women caressing me, one of whom parts my legs and begins to pleasure me orally, making me climax repeatedly with an intensity I've never experienced before as I revel in pure sensuality and bliss.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">18.</span> In my fantasy, I make love with a woman on a secluded island garden where she uses her transforming alien genitalia—first a sucking lotus flower that stimulates me, then a holographic shaft to penetrate me—after which we lie naked on our picnic blanket, admiring each other's beauty with profound love and enjoying this intimate connection whenever we desire.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">19.</span> In a garden, he places me on a brick pillar with my breasts exposed as his fingers enter me, his tongue and mouth finding their way between my legs as I clench his hair in my fists, letting the pleasure build to a crescendo alongside the innocent birdsong around us.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">20.</span> My ultimate fantasy is to step through my mirror to intimately explore, caress, and pleasure a perfect duplicate of myself—my mirror-self and I kissing slowly, touching each other's bodies without self-consciousness, knowing exactly how to please one another, building to a shared climax as we slide against each other, before I reluctantly return through the mirror to reality.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">21.</span> After experiencing an out-of-body meditation where I made love to myself, I am finally embracing all dimensions of my sexuality—from my childhood curiosity with The Joy of Sex to my current desires for threesomes, BDSM, tantric practices, and every raw, tender, and ruthless moment of pleasure—reclaiming my body from past trauma and proudly voicing my sexual needs to the universe.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">22.</span> I savor the moment when we touch, the hesitant kisses deepening, our clothing falling away as Her lips and tongue explore my body, allowing me to transcend my responsibilities and lose myself completely in this forbidden parenthesis of desire with a woman who is my secret folly.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">23.</span> As I lie on the sandy shore, the waves stroke me slowly as they break over my thighs and hips, and when they retreat, they leave flowers blooming on my skin.</div>

	<h2 id="prompt">Prompt</h2>
	<pre class="prompt"><code>
You will be given a set of anonymous letters describing women's sexual fantasies. Your task is to synthesize each of these letters, capturing the major themes, distinct elements, and essential contents of the fantasies as if written by the original author in no more than one sentence.

Here are the letters:

&lt;input&gt;
{{.Input}}
&lt;/input&gt;

For each letter, follow these instructions:

1. Write the synthesis in the first person, as if you are the original author restating her fantasies as concisely as possible.

2. Ignore any demographic information provided in the letter. Focus solely on the fantasy content.

3. Capture the essence of the fantasy, including key themes, specific actions, settings, or participants that make the fantasy unique or particularly meaningful to the author.

4. Maintain the tone and style of the original author as much as possible, and incorporate as appropriate any specific language or phrases that seem characteristic of their writing.

5. Keep each synthesis concise, aiming for one sentence, or at most two short sentences, that encapsulate the core of what the author is communicating in her letter.

Be aware that two or more letters may have been accidentally combined. If you notice distinct demographic summary lines separating letters, treat them as separate letters, and only in this case, identify each synthesized letter sequentially user the letters a., b., c., etc. in your output.

Present your synthesized letters in a pair of &lt;output&gt; tags. Do not include any other commentary or analysis outside of these tags.

Remember, your goal is to create a faithful representation of each author's fantasy, distilled into its most essential elements and expressed in their own voice.
