    <h3 id="on-fantasies"><span class="number">1.</span> On Fantasies</h2>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">1.</span> I am caught in a contradiction of desires—wanting to be independent yet dominated, to be worshipped yet roughly taken, to feel safe while controlled—as I struggle through shame about my sexual yearnings, seeking to understand myself as both an intellectual woman and a desiring animal who fantasizes about being fucked against a bathroom wall at a party by someone who reads my needs, teases me to the edge, and fills me in rhythm with the music vibrating through us both.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">2.</span> I fantasize about having a penis to experience the pleasure of making love to women with passion, yet what I truly long for is a loving connection with a woman who desires and cherishes me, even if just for a brief, beautiful moment.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">3.</span> Despite my inexperience, I've developed increasingly adventurous fantasies since discovering my queerness, ranging from BDSM to group sex at parties where I'm touching others intimately, yet I struggle with how these explicit daydreams both liberate and consume me, distracting from real life even as I crave the unofficial encounters I'm too afraid to pursue.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">4.</span> I fantasize about my husband dying so I could be brave enough to explore a deeply suppressed attraction to women, specifically a former co-worker whose touch once made my body burn with desire despite my contentment in marriage to my best friend.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">5.</span> While appearing to engage in ordinary daily activities like shopping or commuting, I secretly craft elaborate sexual fantasies about famous figures or imaginary men—sometimes even women—in various steamy scenarios, maintaining a slight smile as I interact normally with the world.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">6.</span> My fantasy is to be utterly desired and completely ravished by a partner who explores my body like it's a drug, making me feel uniquely desirable exactly as I am, which intensifies my own arousal.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">7.</span> In my sexual fantasies, I envision various people—sometimes women, sometimes men, sometimes even versions of myself with different features—but never actually me, because whenever I imagine myself participating, the mood instantly crashes and I feel disgusted.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">8.</span> "I practise lucid dreaming. Every night I dream I have sex with the actor Pedro Pascal."</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">9.</span> Since discovering fantasy as a tool for sexual enjoyment, I've imagined scenarios with multiple cocks—men riding each other, groups masturbating around me, or myself as the centerpiece at a banquet surrounded by eager old men with erections of all shapes and sizes.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">10.</span> Since high school, I've fantasized exclusively about being dominated by older women, a secret I've never shared with my husband or therapist despite it being my only path to orgasm, leaving me torn between sexual fulfillment and guilt.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">11.</span> I live a beautiful life with my husband, but I fantasize about two alternate lives: one filled with rough, impersonal encounters with dominant men, and another where I experience all-consuming, passionate love with a wild, free-spirited woman.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">12.</span> Despite my husband's view of me as vanilla, I fantasize about being a famous trans porn star and sexual icon, longing to be valued for my body through cosmetic procedures and starring in adult films or modeling nude, while in reality I content myself with filming our own intimate moments.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">13.</span> I long for the intimate touch and passionate sex I once shared with my late husband, finding myself caught between grief for our lost physical connection and fleeting relief in harmless infatuations with actors on screen during my lonely nights of widowhood.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">14.</span> To escape the loneliness of my nearly sexless marriage, I create elaborate fantasy worlds where I'm powerful and sexually free—sometimes a survivor in a zombie apocalypse with a supportive lover, other times a beautiful witch having uninhibited encounters with wizards and witches, always in control and with every detail meticulously crafted.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">15.</span> My fantasy includes both domestic bliss where my husband helps with chores and compliments me genuinely, and sensual pleasure—from him eating me out, to touching me delicately, to finding that perfect position for my elusive orgasm, followed by an affirming pounding from behind, ending in a bath overlooking a breezy summer garden.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">16.</span> Despite being told fantasies are sinful, I cultivate vivid sexual dreams about real men I admire because they give me the will to live—the hope that one day I might experience mind-blowing sex keeps me going through the daily grind.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">17.</span> I dream of finding a partner, particularly an older, taller woman with a deep voice, who sees my wheelchair and disabilities as part of me but not the whole of me, who respects my needs while taking control in the bedroom, and who allows me to be willingly submissive in a safe, caring environment where I can feel completely desirable.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">18.</span> When I fantasize to become aroused for sex with my husband or to masturbate myself to sleep, I imagine fictional characters (never myself) getting drunk together, confessing feelings, and becoming intimate—it's their special connection and vulnerability that turns me on, not sexual attraction to actual people.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">19.</span> In my most secret fantasy, I practice a 'masturtation'—a blend of meditation and masturbation—where I imagine my boyfriend proposing to me in a lush, mysterious setting, culminating in intense sexual pleasure when the moment reaches its emotional peak.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">20.</span> I fantasize about being a successful, younger version of myself who Harry Styles falls for and has passionate sex with, or about my partner reluctantly succumbing to another woman's seduction while I masturbate and often cry afterward.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">21.</span> Growing up with religious guilt, I fantasize about sexual freedom in nature—making love in sand dunes, forest floors, or even backstage in costume during theater productions—all spontaneous, wild acts that defy the sexual restraint imposed by my religion and marriage.</div>

    <h3 id="rough-and-ready"><span class="number">2.</span> Rough and Ready</h2>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">1.</span> In my dream, I encounter a mysterious man who knows my soul completely, and as we engage in an intensely intimate sexual connection that transcends the physical, I realize I am making love to my own soul—my masculine and feminine merging in a sublime, spiritual act of self-love that carries me into transcendent ecstasy.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">2.</span> I want to be utterly used and objectified, all my holes filled by strangers' cocks as an audience watches, allowing me to escape my mental load and exist solely as a vessel for primal pleasure.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">3.</span> Despite being a feminist in control of my life, I deeply crave surrender—to be completely possessed, with hands on my neck and a body against mine, hearing whispered filth and sounds of desire that tell me I'm truly wanted.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">4.</span> I fantasize about my supervisor at work dominating me completely—his strong hands exploring my body, his mouth against my skin, fucking me on his desk after hours, leaving me filled with him all day, with equal parts rough, desperate sex and tender aftercare, creating a world where only he and I exist in our passionate connection.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">5.</span> I crave sex so intense it makes me lose consciousness, leaves me obsessing for days, and becomes a memory I'll pleasure myself to for years, plus I fantasize about creating passionate abstract art with my partner using our bodies and fluids that we'd secretly display for unknowing guests.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">6.</span> "Deep raw-dog anal."</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">7.</span> I fantasize about being a machine that feeds and nourishes others through every orifice of my body, rhythmically pumping and being consumed by multiple lovers who suckle and penetrate me in an endless, mindless cycle of giving and receiving sustenance.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">8.</span> My fantasies have evolved from romantic lovemaking to being railed—desiring the freedom of losing control and being irresistibly taken, while sometimes still drifting to thoughts of Birgitte from Borgen coming home after politics to fuck me on the kitchen table by refrigerator light.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">9.</span> Standing naked before my mirror, I admire my curves and rawness before indulging in fantasies of him pinning me against walls, finger-fucking me, tongue-fucking my hungry pussy, licking honey from my body, and making me squirt just from imagination.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">10.</span> I fantasize about "Jason," an actor whose embrace allows me to be vulnerable enough to experience multiple orgasms during our passionate lovemaking—something I've rarely achieved in real life, especially after breast cancer—as he accepts my body fully, whispering reassurances while I dirty talk him to mutual climax.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">11.</span> Despite being a feminist, I fantasize about being dominated, degraded, and used solely for a man's pleasure, with my deepest fantasy being repeatedly impregnated and milked in breeding stalls—a contradiction to my beliefs that makes me orgasm every time.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">12.</span> My most private and paradoxical fantasy is to have someone ejaculate inside me—despite my fear of pregnancy—surrendering to that raw, messy intimacy where I can both control and let go, coaxing ultimate pleasure from my partner as they fill me completely.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">13.</span> In my fantasies, I open myself to strangers—unknown men or women—who take me roughly, without love or tenderness, dominating me completely as I surrender to pure lust while the risk of being seen heightens my pleasure, all a stark contrast to my satisfying but predictable married sex life.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">14.</span> I crave passionate, animalistic sex where I'm dominated and held so tight it leaves marks - the all-consuming kind where I'm engulfed in sensations, feeling the thrill of controlled helplessness, and waking up pleasantly sore the next day.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">15.</span> Despite being a strong-minded woman usually in control during sex, I fantasize about being completely ravaged by a tall German man who would exhaust me with such intense pleasure that I'd be left dripping, grinning, and unable to stand for days.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">16.</span> I crave explosive, primal sex where I'm so consumed by desire I can't think straight—not the disappointing encounters I've had, but a passionate power struggle where clothes are torn off against walls, obscenities are shouted, and I'm finally, completely present in the moment.</div>

    <h3 id="to-be-worshiped"><span class="number">3.</span> To Be Worshipped</h2>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">1.</span> My greatest sexual fantasy is to be worshipped as a divine, powerful goddess by a partner who is utterly obsessed with me, begging for my attention and praising me endlessly while I maintain complete control over our passionate, unhurried lovemaking, knowing they'll leave believing I'm the pinnacle of women who will forever occupy their fantasies.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">2.</span> My fantasies are not just about sex but about the exquisite sensitivity of my entire body—I long to float in bliss, caressed by many hands, every inch of my skin awakened and worshipped as something precious.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">3.</span> I crave to be worshipped by a masculine yet tender man who secretly observes me undressing, then surprises me with passionate attention to my body, building up to intense, powerful sex where I can surrender completely while feeling seen, adored, and utterly desired.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">4.</span> My fantasy is to be truly desired by someone who craves me carnally and obscenely, who becomes wild with passion at the mere sight of my body—perhaps it's a power fantasy, but the thought of being desperately wanted turns me on immensely.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">5.</span> My deepest fantasy is to be worshipped as a powerful goddess, commanding a room with my presence and having men bow to my every whim, begging and thanking me for allowing them sexual access to my divine body—a forbidden desire given my upbringing in a fundamentalist Christian, male-dominated society.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">6.</span> Despite being a lesbian with no attraction to men or penises, I find it scorchingly hot to imagine someone ejaculating inside me—the thought that my body could please someone to the point they lose control and fill me is intoxicating.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">7.</span> My fantasy involves a man I'm strongly attracted to—either a past lover, crush, or celebrity—who genuinely appreciates me, makes me feel special and safe, engages in passionate but tender lovemaking, and stays to cherish me afterward, embodying what I crave most: someone being truly glad when I walk into the room.</div>

    <h3 id="off-limits"><span class="number">4.</span> Off Limits</h2>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">1.</span> I am in love with my best friend and constantly fantasize about touching and fucking her, even during my normal day-to-day activities.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">2.</span> I fantasize about intimate encounters with women - particularly actresses or fictional characters - imagining their kisses, scents, and everything that might unfold between us, creating intense, beautiful, and dreamlike scenes in my mind, though I've never acted on these desires and keep them private due to cultural taboos.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">3.</span> In a thrilling encounter at my friend's place with the kids and husband away, she kisses me which leads to passionate exploration of each other's bodies—she pleasures me to unimaginable heights, then I reciprocate, discovering the joy of female intimacy for the first time and experiencing the most intense orgasms of my life.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">4.</span> I fantasize about the married bricklayer next door, longing for his touch after two years of innocent flirtation during lockdown, still wearing his gifted hoodie and wondering if he thinks of me when I wear it, our only physical contact a goodbye hug that left me wanting so much more.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">5.</span> I imagine a passionate but forbidden affair with an unattainable woman where we escape together, share intimate conversations until dawn, and experience a connection that transcends physical touch, all while knowing our love story, told through lingering glances, is destined for heartbreak—perhaps my fear of true connection makes me crave the unattainable.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">6.</span> In my fantasy, my husband's overnight friend catches me masturbating, joins me for passionate sex in our home office, then surprises me with another quick, intense encounter the next morning while my oblivious husband prepares for their trip.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">7.</span> I dream of finding an empty church and having a man, possibly a young priest, go down on me as I lie on the altar, my pleasure-filled moans echoing throughout the space—a rebellious act against religious dogma that forbids women from sacred spaces.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">8.</span> I fantasize about being fucked in a church, in the pews beneath stained-glass windows while looking at Jesus on the cross.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">9.</span> I fantasize about an illicit affair with a pastoral couple where I'd become their sexual throuple partner—enjoying the taboo of being counseled by religious authority figures, perhaps with voyeuristic elements reminiscent of the Jerry Falwell Jr. scandal.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">10.</span> While outwardly I've perfectly executed my traditional South Asian marriage, I secretly fantasize about my brother-in-law watching—or even replacing—my husband during sex, his burning gaze fulfilling the desire he's silently carried for years.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">11.</span> I fantasize about hooking up with my best friend's forbidden, well-endowed brother, imagining our passionate encounter where he fulfills my every desire—from oral pleasure to rough sex—with the added thrill of potentially being caught by his sister.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">12.</span> I fantasize about the woman from my past who dominated me completely—pressing me against her wall, holding my wrists with one hand while penetrating me anally with the other, making me squirt uncontrollably as our blonde and brunette curls entwined like dessert.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">13.</span> I fantasize about living in an Italian mansion managing an elderly man's art collection while having passionate trysts with his two very different sons—first separately, including office sex and tender moments, and later together in wild threesomes—which evolves into a complex narrative where I marry the older brother but maintain an open relationship that includes his younger brother, resulting in children from both men.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">14.</span> Though I love my husband and our good sex life (complete with toys), I secretly fantasize about being fisted and feeling completely FULL, but I'm too embarrassed to ask him despite my sex-positive upbringing.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">15.</span> My most intense fantasy is of my boyfriend ejaculating inside me without a condom, which would trigger my own orgasm instantly, and I imagine savoring his semen inside me as the ultimate expression of our love.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">16.</span> I fantasize about my therapist, a gorgeous older woman with a tiny tattoo and authoritative English accent, imagining our final session ending with passionate kissing, oral sex, and multiple orgasms, though I know it remains only in my wildest dreams.</div>

    <h3 id="the-captive"><span class="number">5.</span> The Captive</h2>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">1.</span> My most intense fantasy, despite my feminist values, involves faceless men entering my apartment uninvited who, upon discovering how aroused I am while blindfolded and restrained, can't help but touch me with increasingly bold hands until one finally breaches me with a deep, lustful stroke—the moment that inevitably brings me to climax.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">2.</span> My fantasy involves being caught by a group of attractive biker men who initially tease me, then take turns using all three of my holes while I pretend to resist but secretly enjoy their rough treatment, especially when they spank me, attach a vibrator to my clit, and forcibly penetrate me anally while I experience multiple orgasms.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">3.</span> My fantasy involves being kidnapped by terrorists and experiencing intense, passionate sex with a captor who treats my body with tenderness and respect, yet whose eyes betray the violence and danger that paradoxically arouses me, ultimately setting me free once we're finished.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">4.</span> In my fantasies, I am never in control—I'm either injured and incapacitated, needing care from mysterious figures, or I'm tied up and menaced in ways where my consent doesn't matter, offering a freedom my real-life relationships cannot provide.</div>

    <h3 id="kink"><span class="number">6.</span> Kink</h2>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">1.</span> I secretly pleasure myself on the office door handle I'm attracted to, sneaking in after hours to enjoy its full girth and stretchiness that my husband can't provide.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">2.</span> I fantasize about hairy men—their chests, bellies, thighs, and especially their vulnerable armpits, which completely short-circuit my brain when exposed—wanting to explore every inch with my lips while feeling their warm bodies against mine.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">3.</span> I find period sex incredibly raw, messy, natural, and intimate—whether heterosexual or lesbian—as there's something beautifully stigma-breaking and bonding about making love while bleeding that feels both sweet and deliciously "nasty."</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">4.</span> I fantasize about a disembodied, questing penile tentacle that repeatedly penetrates me from below, slipping between my tightly closed legs, while I also get aroused imagining myself breastfeeding adult men who either greedily enjoy my milk or are peaceful and contented.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">5.</span> I love to deliberately wet my bed, clothing, or pull-ups as a deeply liberating sexual experience that makes me feel confident yet sometimes submissive, with my ultimate fantasy involving a caring partner who helps me after my "accidents," combining comfort with occasional elements of humiliation.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">6.</span> I am captivated by the "hucow" breeding fantasy, longing to be "filled" with endless semen, feeling it finish deep inside me and run down my thighs, a sensation so arousing it constantly occupies my daydreams.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">7.</span> My biggest sexual fantasy is roleplaying as a black leopard with claws and a sadistic streak, guarding my mistress at her throne or being commanded to hunt other submissives—a powerful dynamic in the grey area between dominance and submission.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">8.</span> My deepest fantasy is to be a transgender woman in a lesbian relationship, wearing and wetting diapers with my partner, fulfilling both my gender identity and AB/DL desires that have been part of me since childhood.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">9.</span> I fantasize about blood exchange with a lover—being bound, controlled, and cut with cold surgical scissors or a scalpel drawing blood that's licked and swallowed—finding intense eroticism in the taboo intersection of blood, submission, and intimacy.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">10.</span> My deepest fantasy involves shared gluttony and belly bloating during intimacy, where partners and I would indulge in a big meal, then explore each other's bodies—especially rubbing and appreciating our full bellies—in a threesome scenario that makes me feel normal and desired despite my unconventional turn-on.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">11.</span> During my period, I fantasize about a Victorian vampire-themed ritual where masked women are strapped to metal frames in a windowless room, and men wearing Venetian masks extract menstrual blood from our bodies before pleasuring us orally and anally, all while we watch each other in shared ecstasy.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">12.</span> Thanks to my mother's early education and my own curiosity, I'm aroused by male urination—the masculine, dominating sight of a peeing penis turns me on, a fantasy I've finally shared with my partner after years of hesitation.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">13.</span> In an emergency with painfully full breasts leaking milk at a store, I let a young shop assistant suckle me in the mother's room, which arouses us both and leads to passionate sex as he drinks my milk and I enjoy his thick cock.</div>

    <h3 id="strangers"><span class="number">7.</span> Strangers</h2>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">1.</span> I fantasize about visiting a clinic where I'm given a gentle, permission-based sexual experience with a caring male doctor who helps me orgasm while he becomes aroused, ultimately leading to mutual pleasure as he enters me just before I climax intensely.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">2.</span> I fantasize about being anonymously taken on a crowded morning tram after following instructions to wear no underwear, where a stranger's rough hands explore me under my skirt, forcefully penetrates me without anyone noticing, and then I realize with both fear and excitement that all the surrounding men are waiting for their turn.</div>

    <div class="letter"><span class="number">7.</span> As a strong, dominant woman in both business and bedroom, my deepest fantasy is to surrender all control—to be tied up, edged repeatedly, disciplined with tiny punishments, kept in line, and begging at my master's feet, finally experiencing the raw vulnerability of submission without overthinking.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">8.</span> Despite my feminist ideals and control in my professional life, I crave the complete opposite sexually: to be dominated, degraded and humiliated by my boyfriend through choking, name-calling, spanking, and public teasing—surrendering to the danger and loss of control that excites me.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">9.</span> I fantasize about passionate sex with a woman who dominates me with restraints, toys, and rough play—spanking me, pulling my hair, choking me, using a strap-on—while also desiring the freedom to switch roles, explore her body, and provide intimate aftercare when we're done.</div>

    <div class="letter"><span class="number">12.</span> In my sixties, I finally understand my fantasy: I'm spread open on the forest floor, beach, or hillside with animals watching, where one or all of them—often a deer—performs cunnilingus on me, or sometimes I become a landscape with a river flowing through me.</div>

    <div class="letter"><span class="number">18.</span> In my fantasy, I make love with a woman in an isolated garden where she uses her transforming alien genitalia—first a sucking lotus flower, then a holographic shaft for penetration—to bring us both to climax before we bask in post-coital bliss amidst nature.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">19.</span> In a garden, I arch my back as he explores me intimately, his fingers and tongue bringing waves of pleasure while the birds watch innocently, until I clench, thrust, and finally cascade into climax.</div>

    <div class="letter"><span class="number">22.</span> I lose myself in our forbidden encounter—her comforting embrace evolves into passionate kisses and caresses, her lips exploring my body until I surrender completely to desire, forgetting my responsibilities as she becomes my secret parenthesis from everyday life.</div>
    <div class="letter"><span class="number">23.</span> As waves stroke my thighs and hips on a sandy shore, they retreat to leave flowers blooming across my skin.</div>

	<h2 id="prompt">Prompt</h2>
	<pre class="prompt"><code>
You will be given a set of anonymous letters describing women's sexual fantasies. Your task is to synthesize each of these letters, capturing the major themes, distinct elements, and essential contents of the fantasies as if written by the original author in no more than one sentence.

Here are the letters:

&lt;input&gt;
{{.Input}}
&lt;/input&gt;

For each letter, follow these instructions:

1. Write the synthesis in the first person, as if you are the original author restating her fantasies as concisely as possible.

2. Ignore any demographic information provided in the letter. Focus solely on the fantasy content.

3. Capture the essence of the fantasy, including key themes, specific actions, settings, or participants that make the fantasy unique or particularly meaningful to the author.

4. Maintain the tone and style of the original author as much as possible, and incorporate as appropriate any specific language or phrases that seem characteristic of their writing.

5. Keep each synthesis concise, aiming for one sentence, or at most two short sentences, that encapsulate the core of what the author is communicating in her letter.

Be aware that two or more letters may have been accidentally combined. If you notice distinct demographic summary lines or clear topic shifts separating letters, treat them as separate letters, and *only in this case* then label each synthesis sequentially (a.), (b.), (c.), etc., together on a single line. Only add labels to your synthesized letters if there's clear evidence they are distinct submissions.

Present your synthesized letters in a pair of &lt;output&gt; tags. Do not include any other commentary or analysis outside of these tags.

Remember, your goal is to create a faithful representation of each author's fantasy, distilled into its most essential elements and expressed in their own voice, while maintaining approximately 15-30 words per synthesis. 

If the letter is short, less than 15-30 words already, please just quote ("[...]") the entire letter rather than provide a synthesis.
